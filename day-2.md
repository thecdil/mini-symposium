# Digital Project Components and Platforms

> Wednesday, May 20th, 10:00am - 12:00pm, CDIL Zoom.

## Objectives

- explore some common components of scholarly publishing platforms
- situate the fellows in histories
- explore scholarly publishing platforms


## Outline: 

### Discussion of DH Projects

- What did you see? 
- source, data, tools, outputs, people (can you see these?)
- Talk about what you chose

### Telling/Writing/Making with Data

#### Some Common Components of Digital Projects*

***Community***

- **people** to perform/manage/create the workflows
    - data wranglers
    - project managers
    - designers
    - developers

- **users** 
    - now
    - future

***Infrastructure***

- **space**
    - to collaborate/meet/learn
    - can be virtual

- **funding**
    - often invisible how much goes into this work

- ***adminstrative support***
    - essentially: permission for the funding and the space

***Process***

- **data** 
    - What is data? (Territory)
        - the given
    - What is information? (Map)
        - "a difference which makes a difference" 
    - What's the difference?
        - "the map is not the territory"
        - curation is often the beginning of a project

[Gregory Bateson](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/bateson/)
[The Original Article/talk](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/bateson/Bateson_Difference.pdf)

Data --> Information --> Knowledge --> Wisdom

    - Ok, so what's content? 

- **development** to process the data
    - build relationships
    - standardize for use

- **workflows** to make data work with the design
    - data to information
    - information to standard

- **design** to visualize and make accessible the data
    - information architecture
    - ux/ui
    - information visualization

- **interpretation** (+1)
    - it's all levels of interpretation
    - but there is also a contextual interpretation that seems most "scholarly"
        - funding agencies pay attention
        - tenure processes


All these components can tell different stories about the project. As we see with the three essays from Kindred Britain, projects can be described from many different vantages. 

### Kindred Britain

- [originating](http://kindred.stanford.edu/notes.html?section=originating) | [designing](http://kindred.stanford.edu/notes.html?section=designing) | [developing](http://kindred.stanford.edu/notes.html?section=developing)

- [Kindred Britain](http://kindred.stanford.edu/#)
    - [Paltrow to Shakespeare](http://kindred.stanford.edu/#/path/full/none/none/I13754/I27325/)

- [Scott Murray 'wrote the book'](https://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book-2e)


### Questions for the Fellows

- What's your content? 
- What might you learn from breaking out the content further? 
    - Thinking like: a designer, a developer, an originator
- What sort of help do you need? 
- Are your initial ideas possible? What sort of compromises are you willing to make? 
- How do you want your project to look/feel/work in 5 years?

### Digital Collection and Exhibit Platforms Introductions
- [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) (popular CMS for exhibits and teaching. Classroom example [The History Harvest](http://historyharvest.unl.edu/). See [Educators guide](http://info.omeka.net/omeka-net-help/use-case-educators/), [free hosted version](http://www.omeka.net/))

# Follow up Activity

[Mt Devin](https://arcg.is/LDbH9)

- Screw Around with Story Maps
    - Make Your Own Story Map, using either Classic or New Templates
        - Do it quickly, using whatever is at hand
        - Try out different features and modes
        - Import others' maps and photos (easier with CLASSIC)

    - Make a new Issue that links to your StoryMap
        - Go to [Issues](https://github.com/thecdil/mini-symposium/issues)
        - Click green button to add new issue.
        - tag @dcnb in each
        - make a short list (in Markdown!) with a few observations on your processs
        -[example](https://github.com/thecdil/mini-symposium/issues/2)
