# Prep for CDIL Mini-Symposium 

Reading:
Stephen Ramsay, ["The Hermeneutics of Screwing Around; or What You Do with a Million Books" (2010)](https://libraries.uh.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ramsay-The-Hermeneutics-of-Screwing-Around.pdf).

Please create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not have one already.

### Text Editor [optional]

This mini-symposium will use web based tools to simplify set up.
However, going forward with your work it will be helpful to have a good text editor. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for larger projects.

Free, open source cross platform text editor suggestions:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
