### Text Editor [optional]

To simplify set up, in this workshop we will use GitHub's built in web editor to create files.
If you would like to go further working with code on your local computer, you need a good text editor. 

All code is [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text). 
Word processors do not handle plain text with out altering it.
Windows notepad does not handle UTF-8 encoding or UNIX line endings that are standard on the web. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for larger projects.

Open-source cross platform text editor suggestions:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
