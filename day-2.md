### Telling/Writing/Making with Data

#### Some Common Components of Digital Projects*

***Process***

- **data** 
    - What is data? (Territory)
        - the given
    - What is information? (Map)
        - "a difference that makes a difference" 
    - What's the difference?
        - "the map is not the territory"
        - curation is often the beginning of a project

[Gregory Bateson](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/bateson/)
[The Original Article/talk](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/scientists/bateson/Bateson_Difference.pdf)

Data --> Information --> Knowledge --> Wisdom

- **development** to process the data
    - build relationships
    - standardize for use

- **workflows** to make data work with the design
    - data to information
    - information to standard

- **design** to visualize and make accessible the data
    - information architecture
    - ux/ui
    - information visualization

- **interpretation** (+1)
    - it's all interpretation
    - and then there's the special interpretation
    - but their is also a distinction be

***Community***

- **people** to perform/manage/create the workflows
    - data wranglers
    - project managers
    - designers
    - developers

- **users** 
    - now
    - future

***Infrastructure***

- **space**
    - to collaborate/meet/learn
    - can be virtual

- **funding**
    - often invisible how much goes into this work

- ***adminstrative support***
    - essentially: permission for the funding and the space

All these components can tell different stories about the project. The collaborative nature of them,
