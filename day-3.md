# Text as Data: Analysis and Modeling

> Thursday, May 21th, 1:00pm - 3:00pm, CDIL Zoom.

## Objectives

- Critical understanding of text as data.
- Explore text analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Readings

- Ted Underwood, ["Seven Ways Humanists are Using Computers to Understand Text"](https://tedunderwood.com/2015/06/04/seven-ways-humanists-are-using-computers-to-understand-text/) (2015). (intro overview of types of computational analysis)
- Matt Jockers, [The LDA Buffet is Now Open; or, Latent Dirichlet Allocation for English Majors](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/) (Topic Modeling "Fable")

# Outline: 

Follow along with the day's activities using [Text as Data](https://owikle.github.io/text-as-data/) workshop site

## Text Analysis:

*To follow along see the [Text as Data](https://owikle.github.io/text-as-data/) workshop site*

**Prepping your text**
- Finding and preparing text for analysis
- OCR and text cleaning

**Text Analysis**
- Word frequency and concordance with [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)
- Visualizing context with [WordTree](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/)

## Machine Learning

*To follow along see the [Topic Modeling](https://owikle.github.io/topicmodeling/) workshop site*
- Topic Modeling in-browser with [jsLDA](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/)

**Exploring big data**
- Google Books [Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams)
- HathiTrust [Research Center Portal](https://sharc.hathitrust.org)


## Additional Readings

- Ted Underwood and Jordan Sellers, ["How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?"](https://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394). 
    - article explicitly explains the research process, from collecting/selecting data to analysis. Published as a draft with more content, questions, and illustrations than are allowed in a traditional article. Also published traditionally as, Jordan Sellers and Ted Underwood, "The Longue DurÃ©e of Literary Prestige", MLQ 77:3 (2016). Additionally, a GitHub repository shares the code necessary to reproduce the analysis, [paceofchange](https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange) (2015).
- Extra: [Cultural Analytics Now](http://post45.research.yale.edu/sections/contemporaries/cultural-analytics-now/), ed. Dan Sinykin, *post45* (2019).
    - A collection of articles critically evaluating the current state of quantitative methods in DH, particularly literary studies. First article is a review of Underwood's most recent book, *Distant Horizons*.
